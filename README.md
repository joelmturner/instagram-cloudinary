# Instagram to Cloudinary

This repo pulls images from Instagram, filters them by hashtag, and sends them to Cloudinary. A deeper explanation of how it all works is in the [Instagram to Cloudinary](https://joelmturner.com/blog/instagram-to-cloudinary/) post.

Add credentials to `.env` and run command, `yarn start` to see it work.
